# Hi! I'm Samrat ('Sam'), originally from Bangladesh.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/) at the [University of Arkansas, Fayetteville](http://www.uark.edu/) (UofA) and serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Intelligent Information Sensing and Transmission Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Jingxian Wu](https://wuj.hosted.uark.edu/). My research focus is on developing sequential analysis based optimization algorithms with applications in various fields of electrical engineering. Currently, I'm working on my dissertation titled "Low Latency Anomaly Detection with Imperfect Models" with the target of graduating in May 2020.
# I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/). During my senior year, I worked on "Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Scheme for Human Action Recognition" in my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://sites.google.com/site/drshaikhfattah/). After my undergrad, I came to USA in Spring 2016 to pursue my doctoral studies at the UofA. I had the opportunity to work on different kinds of projects during last 4 years. My research studies deal with Optimization, Machine Learning, Seuqntial Analysis, Statistical Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Pattern Recognition among many other topics. For now, my goal is to have a stimulating research-centric career concentrated on data science and algorithm development.
